## ðŸ“– Game Rules (Just Like Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples)

### Setup
1. Players connect to a game session via a room code.
2. One player is selected as the "Dealer" for each round.

### Gameplay
1. The Dealer plays a black card with a prompt or question (e.g., "Why can't I sleep at night?").
2. The other players choose the funniest white card from their hand to complete the sentence or answer the question.
3. The Dealer reviews the responses and selects the one they find funniest.

### Winning
- The player whose card is chosen wins that round and earns a point.
- The first player to reach a predefined number of points wins the game.

### Additional "Fun"
- The game is customizable with different rule variations to keep things interesting.
