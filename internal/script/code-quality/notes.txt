# GENAI IGNORE THIS PART

Create a super good code directory parser
Multiple Passes, Iterative like Radioisity, Diminishing retruns

Pass 1: Analysis
Dump Entire Codebase into Markdown file.

Reviewer

Repeat, Filter (filter out ones that look good) or End
Keep filtering reults (files) down until done.

For each pass, determine which of the filters to appply in which order.
May only want to apply certain ones to hone down

Every pass:

    Repeat Code Quality (Option to repeat step)
 pass to ask AI where more documentation is needed
    Repeat Code Quality (Option to repeat step)
 pass add documentation to areas
    Review updated documentation, ensure correct
pass
    At this point, we've given a lot more context for gen at to make more
    important changes
pass Apply code quality rules
    Review / Finalize Subset of "Good" Files
    Repeat Code Quality (Option to repeat step)

Add additional TSDocs to all places it applies, and add comments to all non-trivial lines of code, ie "const a = 1;" is trivial
